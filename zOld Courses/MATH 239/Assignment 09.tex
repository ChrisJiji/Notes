\item \begin{enumerate}
    \item By theorem 7.7.2, we know that $G$ is 2-colourable. Let $G$ be coloured by colours $A,B$, and let $e$ be any edge connecting an $A$-coloured vertex and a $B$-coloured vertex. We can do this without any loss of generality because $G$ is bipartite, and so every edge is an edge that connects an $A$-coloured vertex to a $B$-coloured vertex. Let us induct on the length of the path, $P$, we are replacing $e$ with in our subdivision. When the length of $P$ is 1, then clearly it is just $e$, and is 2-colourable, and hence 3-colourable. Then $P$ is 3-colourable for any length $\leq n$. Now take the length of $P=\{u_1,u_2,\ldots,u_{n+1}\}$ to be $n+1$. Since the endpoints of $P$ are two different colours, say $u_1$ is colour $A$ and $u_{n+1}$ is colour $B$. Then clearly the path $\{u_1,\ldots,u_n\}$ is a path of length $n$ and is $2-$colourable. Furthermore, we can colour $u_1$ colour $A$, then $u_2$ colour $C$, then $u_3$ colour $A$, etc. such that every colour will not be the colour of $u_{n+1}$. Then adding on $u_{n+1}$ to our path of 2 colours, $P$ is 3-colourable. Then by induction, $P$ is 3-colourable for any length. Then, for any size subdivision of any edge in $G$, that path is 3-colourable. Since all of the edges in $G$ connect vertices coloured $A$ to vertices coloured $B$ in $G$, then $H$ is 3-colourable.

\end{tikzpicture} Note that $K_{2,2}$ is 2-colourable since it is bipartite. It is also the 4-cycle. $H$, a subdivision of $K_{2,2}$, is the 5-cycle, and hence not bipartite, and not 2-colourable.

    \item Observe that for two subgraphs of $K_{11}$ to be planar, then both $|E(G)|\leq 3|V(G)|-6$, $|E(H)|\leq 3|V(H)|-6$ need to be satisfied. We know $|V(K_{11})|=11$, and so $|E(G)|$ can be at most $3*11-6=27$. Then since $H$ is the complement, and $|E(K_{11})|=55$, $H$ must have $55-27=28$ edges. But then $|E(H)|=28\geq 27 =3|V(K_{11})|-6$, hence $H$ cannot be planar if $G$ is planar. Clearly if the vertex set of $G$ or $H$ is not the vertex set of $K_{11}$, then this is even more true. Similarly, $G$ cannot be planar if $H$ is planar. 
\end{enumerate}

\item \begin{enumerate}
    \item Since $G$ is planar, by Euler's formula we have $|V(G)|-|E(G)|+|f(G)|=1+c$, where $c$ is the number of components of $G$. If $G$ has no cycles, then we know $|V(G)|=|E(G)|+c$, where $c$ is the number of components. Plugging these formulas into each other, we get $|V(G)|=3|V(G)|-6+c\Rightarrow c=6-2|V(G)|$. Since $|V(G)|\geq4$, we get $c\leq -2$, which is clearly not true, so $G$ has a cycle. \\ 
    Since $G$ contains a cycle, by lemma 7.5.1, every face boundary contains a cycle. Then since a cycle has to have length at least three, every face has degree at least three, and so by handshaking lemma for faces, we have $3|f(G)|\geq 2|E(G)|=2(3|V(G)|-6)\Rightarrow |f(G)|\geq 2|V(G)|-4$. Then, plugging into Euler's formula, we have $|V(G)|-(3|V(G)|-6)+2|V(G)|-4\geq 1+c$. Since the $|V(G)|$'s cancel out, we are left with $1\geq c$. Since $c$ is a non-negative integer, and we know we have at least $4$ vertices, and hence $3*4-6$ edges, $c$ can not be the empty graph, and hence $c=1$, and therefore $G$ is connected. 
    
    
    \item By handshaking lemma for faces, we have $\sum_{F\in f(G)}d^*(F)=2|E(G)|$. But we know $|E(G)|=3|V(G)|-6$, so $\sum_{F\in f(G)}d^*(F)=6|V(G)|-12\Rightarrow |V(G)|=\frac{\sum_{F\in f(G)}d^*(F)+12}{6}$. Then plugging into Euler's formula and the equation given in the question, we get 
    \begin{align*}
    \frac{\sum_{F\in f(G)}d^*(F)+12}{6}-\left(3|V(G)|-6\right)+|f(G)|&=2 \\ 
    \frac{\sum_{F\in f(G)}d^*(F)+12}{6}-\left(3\frac{\sum_{F\in f(G)}d^*(F)+12}{6}-6\right)+|f(G)|&=2 \\ 
    \frac{\sum_{F\in f(G)}d^*(F)}{6}+2-\frac{\sum_{F\in f(G)}d^*(F)}{2}-6+6+|f(G)|&=2 \\
    \frac{\sum_{F\in f(G)}d^*(F)}{2}-\frac{\sum_{F\in f(G)}d^*(F)}{6}&=f|(G)|\\
    \sum_{F\in f(G)}d^*(F)&=3|f(G)|\\
    \end{align*}
    Note that a face cannot have degree 2 or less, (or else it would not be a face in our graph with a cycle, and $|V(G)|\geq4$), so every face has degree exactly 3.
\end{enumerate}

\pagebreak
\item Note that for $a\geq3$, and $b+c\geq3$, we can contract the vertices in one of $b$ or $c$ to create a complete bipartite graph, with the size of both partitions being greater than or equal to three, and hence it contains $K_{3,3}$ as a subdivision, and is not planar. Hence, $K_{a,b,c}$ is planar only when $a\leq2$ and $b+c\geq3$ are true, and $a\geq3$ and $b+c\leq2$ are true. For $a\geq3, b+c\leq2$, the triples $(a,b,c)$ such that these are true are just $(n,1,1)$, where $n\in\mathbb{N}$. For $a\leq2,b+c\geq3$, we first notice that if $b+c\geq5$, they are at least 2 and 3, in which case we have a subdivion of $K_{3,3}$, or they are at least 1 and 4, in which case we have a subdivision of $K_{5}$ if $a=2$ or one of $b,c>1$, and if $a=1$ and one of $b,c=1$, we get a case covered by the above triple. Then we need $3\leq b+c\leq4$. Then we get the triples $(1,2,1),(1,2,2),(2,2,1),(2,2,2)$, and removing repeated cases we get the triples $(2,2,2),(2,2,1)$. Then, all triples $(a,b,c)$ such that $K_{a,b,c}$ is planar are: $(a,1,1), (2,2,2), (2,2,1)$.

\end{enumerate}
